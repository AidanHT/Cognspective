This project is an educational application where users practice teaching a topic to an AI-powered bot. Using the device’s camera and microphone, the system captures delivery details such as tone, emotion, and attention to detail, while the AI analyzes both the accuracy of the explanation and the effectiveness of communication. It then provides personalized feedback, helping users improve their subject mastery through teaching while also strengthening clarity, engagement, and presentation skills. It is supported for different levels of education, ranging from elementary to university.
